### Logic Gates

Wrote the logic for each different logic gate using a Hardware Definition Language,
later used to create the CPU and RAM: these include basic gates such:

- And
- Not
- Or

### CPU

I integrated the chips built into a computer architecture capable of executing programs written in the machine language, the topmost chip within the CPU is the ALU (Arithmetic Logical Unit) which computes a given function on its two given data inputs and outputs the result.

---

### Assembler 

The assembler program I wrote translates symbolic machine language (assembly) to binary code that can be executed by the CPU.

---

### Virtual machine

The VM translates virtual machine commands such as "push constant 2" or "push local 1" into assembly code, which later will be run trought the assembler to generate the equivalent binary code of each VM command. This file is missing some functionalities.
