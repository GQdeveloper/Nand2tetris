### Logic Gates

Wrote the logic for each different logic gate using a Hardware Definition Language,
later used to create the CPU and RAM: these include basic gates such:

- And
- Not
- Or

### CPU

I integrated the chips built into a computer architecture capable of executing
programs written in the machine language, the topmost chip within the CPU 
is the ALU (Arithmetic Logical Unit) which computes computes a given function
on its two given data inputs, and outputs the result.

### Assembler 

Also wrote the program that translates symbolic machine language to binary code that
can be executed by the CPU.

---

### Virtual machine

The VM translates virtual machine commands such as "push constant 2" or "push local 1" into 
assembly code, which later will be run trought the assembler to genarete the equivalent
bynary code of each VM command. This file still missing some functionalities.
